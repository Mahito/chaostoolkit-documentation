## Create your first Experiment

This walkthrough will drive you the basics of writing your very first
experiment.

### Define your hypothesis

Before you start writing code, you need to define your hypthesis. What is it
you are trying to confirm or infirm?

There are various ways to come up with an hypothesis:

* a real scenario that you and your team did not fully get a chance to learn
  from while in emergency mode. Retrospective sessions in agile teams may be
  a great starting point
* [impact mapping][impactmapping] is another strategy to let the team bubble
  up relevant scenarios
* your existing disaster recovery playbooks could be turned into experiments
  that are actively applied against the system

However you come up with your hypothesis, make sure you can analyse the 
result so keep its scope and objective simple and comprehensible.

### Get the requirements

Often, an experiment involves fairly specific access to observe or interact
with the system. Make sure you can gather the right permissions and people on
board.
