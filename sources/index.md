# Welcome to the Chaos Toolkit!

The Chaos Toolkit aims to be the simplest and easiest way to explore building 
your own [Chaos Engineering](http://principlesofchaos.org/) Experiments. It 
also aims to define a vendor and technology independent way of specifying 
Chaos Engineering experiments by providing an 
[Open API](reference/api/experiment.md).

The Chaos Toolkit provides a [CLI](reference/usage/cli.md) that can be used 
to execute the [`discover`](reference/usage/discover.md) -> 
[`init`](reference/usage/init.md) -> [`run`](reference/usage/run.md) -> 
[`report`](reference/usage/report.md) 
[Chaos Engineering workflow](reference/workflow.md).

* [New to Chaos Engineering](new-to-chaos.md) - A useful set of links and 
reference materials if you're new to Chaos Engineering.
* [Getting Started with the Tutorials](getting-started.md) - Get started quickly 
with the online, interactive Chaos Toolkit tutorials.
* [Contributing to the Chaos Toolkit](reference/contributing.md) - There are lots of ways 
to contribute to the free and open source Chaos Toolkit projects. Start to get involved here.
* [Reference](reference/introduction.md) - Reference documentation for when 
you're building your own chaos engineering experiments.
