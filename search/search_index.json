Waiting for those\nconditions arise does not give the time your team needs to handle, learn and\nadapt to the situation at hand.\n\n\nIn many countries, fire alarm tests are conducted at random in offices so \npeople learn how to react well for the benefit of everyone. Software systems\nshould go through the same exercises. The Chaos Toolkit hopes to make it \nsimple and safe to run experiments like these.\n\n\nEngaging the team and organisation\n\u00b6\n\n\nChaos engineering aims at making you learn from your system. This is not a lone\nactivity but a team, potentially the whole organisation, endeavour.\n\n\nIndeed, a hypothesis you could set the hypothesis \u201cwe have been hacked and lost\nusers sensitive data, we should issue a statement we are doing everything to\nfix the problem within 15mn\u201d. This experiment is not really technical but\norganisational: is the chain of information and command working effectively?\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it testing?\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe do not consider testing and chaos engineering to conflict with each other.\nThey both provide useful and actionable feedback. Where they differ is their\nobjective. \n\n\nTesting is a process that aims at telling you if your application,\nwithin controlled boundaries, runs as expected. \n\n\nChaos engineering is a displine of posing a hypothesis before collecting\nevidence to reject or accept that hypothesis.\n\n\nA test is sort of an hypothesis in its own. The difference lies in the\nexperimental approach of the chaos engineering displine. It asks a question and\nthen observe the system to see if we can answer that question positively or\nnegatively.\n\n\nIncidentaly, some forms of testing are not too dissmilar to a chaos engineering\nexperiment. Say for instance, you run a load testing. Your hypothesis is that\nresponse time should not be impacted under load. By running your experiment,\nyou may answer that question.\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it monitoring?\n\u00b6\n\n\nMuch like chaos engineering is not testing, it should not be conflated with\nmonitoring. If anything, chaos engineering strives for good monitoring for it\nhelps observing the system during the experiment.\n\n\nMonitoring surfaces, informs and may even react to confitions in your system.\nBut this is not answering a question like chaos engineering tries to do.\n\n\nWhy a toolkit?\n\u00b6\n\n\nCurrently, running experiments is not an easy task because the ecosystem is \nstill fairly young. Complex cases have been demonstrated at large corporations\nsuch as Netflix or LinkedIn. Tools such as \nChAP\n or \nSimoorg\n\nare powerful but quite involved.\n\n\nThe Chaos Toolkit aims at providing a more straightforward initial user\nexperience to gain confidence in doing Chaos Engineering experiments. The\nsimpler it gets the greater our cognitive capacity to understand what is going\non.\n\n\nUltimately, the Chaos Toolkit should lead you on the path to using richer tools\nsuch as those cited above.\n\n\nWhat does the Chaos Toolkit do?\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Chaos Toolkit user-interface is a command line that takes a JSON-encoded\nfile describing the experiment to run. It consists of a sequence of activities\nthe toolkit executes in order to produce a final report. \n\n\nThe activities are of two kinds. Probes observe the system at various point of\nthe experiment.

In\nthis case, we simply ensure the exchange file exists. That tells us the\nservice has its expectation met.\n\n\nNext, we create the conditions of our hypothesis by pretending our file does not\nexist any longer by renaming it.\n\n\nFinally, we query our service over HTTP and expect a response that does not\nindicate the service is unexpectedly broken.\n\n\nAn experiment is made of any numbering of those activities - probes and actions.\nNote that an action can also have its own probes for a specific inspection\nbefore and after the action was applied.\n\n\nThe steady probe and the action are implemented by using Python functions while\nthe last probe performs a HTTP call on your behalf.

Development made the assumption the file\nwould always be there and did not write a failure code path.  Our hypothesis is that the service should not break but simply try again until\nthe file comes back.   Our experiment should try that hypothesis to see where our system stands.  Below is the code of our service as it is now:  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-  from   datetime   import   datetime  import   io  import   time  import   threading  from   wsgiref.validate   import   validator  from   wsgiref.simple_server   import   make_server  EXCHANGE_FILE   =   \"./exchange.dat\"  def   update_exchange_file (): \n     \"\"\"      Writes the current date and time every 10 seconds into the exchange file.

As you can see, we declare\na simple function that reads a file and returns its content when called.  A background thread function writes the current data to that file every 10\nseconds.

Usually we start with a probe that tells us the steady state of our system. In\nthis case, we simply ensure the exchange file exists. That tells us the\nservice has its expectation met.  Next, we create the conditions of our hypothesis by pretending our file does not\nexist any longer by renaming it.  Finally, we query our service over HTTP and expect a response that does not\nindicate the service is unexpectedly broken.  An experiment is made of any numbering of those activities - probes and actions.\nNote that an action can also have its own probes for a specific inspection\nbefore and after the action was applied.  The steady probe and the action are implemented by using Python functions while\nthe last probe performs a HTTP call on your behalf.

As a user, this means no code and no need to \nlearn a programming language. As a developer, this reduces the functional\nsurface area to consider.\n\n\nExtensibility\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Chaos Toolkit does not wish to be a monolith and strives to be extended to\nfully reach its goal through community driven efforts.\n\n\nBy using a description file, the implementation is not prescribed by the Chaos\nToolkit project. Although we fully expect the community to eventually settle on\ncertain implementations of probes and actions.\n\n\nReadability\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe believe code readbility is a factor for positive maintenance and evolutivity.\n\n\nReadable code never goes out of fashion.
